## Key Metrics Explained

### Organizational Health Score

- **Calculation**: Weighted average of project health, timeline performance, and communication
- **Range**: 0-100 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**:
  - 80+: Excellent organizational health
  - 70-79: Good health with minor areas for improvement
  - 60-69: Moderate health requiring attention
  - <60: Poor health requiring immediate action

### Project Health Score

- **Factors**: Completion rate (30%), timeline adherence (25%), activity level (20%), communication (15%), task freshness (10%)
- **Risk Levels**:
  - Low Risk: 80+ health score
  - Medium Risk: 60-79 health score
  - High Risk: 40-59 health score
  - Critical Risk: <40 health score

### Timeline Performance

- **Metrics**: On-time delivery rate, overdue task percentage, upcoming deadline density
- **Calculation**: Weighted combination of deadline adherence metrics
