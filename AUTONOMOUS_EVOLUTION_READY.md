## 🚀 Launch Sequence

### Option 1: Full Autonomous Evolution (Recommended)
```bash
# Execute the complete autonomous evolution sequence
python3 autonomous_evolution_kickoff.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Phase Execution
```bash
# Phase 1: Self-Analysis Only
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from autonomous_evolution_kickoff import AutonomousEvolutionOrchestrator

async def run_phase_1():
    orchestrator = AutonomousEvolutionOrchestrator()
    await orchestrator.initialize_all_systems()
    results = await orchestrator.execute_phase_1_self_analysis()
    print('Phase 1 Self-Analysis Results:', results)

asyncio.run(run_phase_1())
"
```

### Option 3: Quick Demo Mode
```bash
# Test the Artemis teams without full evolution
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from app.swarms.artemis_agno_teams import ArtemisAGNOTeamFactory

async def demo():
    print('🤖 Deploying Artemis Teams...')
    teams = await ArtemisAGNOTeamFactory.create_all_teams()
    
    print('⚔️ Testing Code Analysis Team...')
    result = await teams['code_analysis'].analyze_codebase({
        'files': ['app/orchestrators/sophia_agno_orchestrator.py'],
        'focus': 'optimization_opportunities'
    })
    print('Analysis Result:', result.get('result', 'Analysis completed'))

asyncio.run(demo())
"
```
