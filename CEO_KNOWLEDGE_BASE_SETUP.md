# üß† CEO Knowledge Base - Airtable Configuration

## Purpose

**Exclusive repository for proprietary and high-level company foundational knowledge**

This Airtable base serves as the CEO's strategic knowledge repository - NOT for operational data from business services (Gong, Slack, etc.). Those remain in their native platforms.

## üéØ Implementation

Your Airtable base is configured at:

- **Base ID:** `appBOVJqGE166onrD`
- **URL:** <https://airtable.com/appBOVJqGE166onrD>

### Next Steps

1. Rename tables to match CEO Knowledge Base structure
2. Add proprietary company documents
3. Document strategic initiatives
4. Log key executive decisions
5. Set up monthly review automation

## üìã Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly reviews of all strategic documents
2. **Classification**: Always classify sensitivity level
3. **Version Control**: Track major revisions in CEO Notes
4. **Access Control**: Limit base access to CEO and authorized executives
5. **Backup**: Regular exports of critical strategic knowledge

This configuration ensures your CEO Knowledge Base remains focused on high-level strategic content while operational data stays in its native platforms where it belongs.
