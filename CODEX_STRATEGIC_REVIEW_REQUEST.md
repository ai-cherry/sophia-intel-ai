## 🎨 APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE DECISION

### **RECOMMENDATION: TWO SEPARATE APPLICATIONS**

**Rationale**:

1. **Domain Separation**: Business and technical domains have fundamentally different workflows, user types, and resource requirements
2. **Security Isolation**: Enterprise customers may want to deploy only business intelligence capabilities without technical access
3. **Scalability**: Independent scaling based on domain-specific usage patterns
4. **Personality Integrity**: Maintains distinct AI personalities without cross-contamination
5. **Development Velocity**: Teams can work independently on domain-specific features

### **Shared Infrastructure Services**

```yaml
# Shared MCP Infrastructure (Port 3333)
services:
  authentication: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
  monitoring: Centralized health monitoring and alerting
  orchestration: Cross-domain task routing and coordination
  storage: Vector databases and knowledge storage
  apis: Shared external API management (Gong, HubSpot, etc.)
```
