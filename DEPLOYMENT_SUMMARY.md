### 🚨 Known Issues

1. Some API endpoints return 404/405 (need route updates)
2. Two enhancement patterns partially implemented
3. Some test cases failing due to import issues

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Complete remaining enhancement patterns
2. Fix failing test endpoints
3. Add missing API route handlers
4. Implement full MCP-UI integration
5. Add performance monitoring

### 📈 Performance

- Server startup: ~2 seconds
- Health check response: <100ms
- Memory search: ~200ms
- Team execution: 1-5 seconds

### 🔒 Security Note

Current configuration has ALL safety features disabled for local development. 
DO NOT deploy to production without re-enabling safety gates.

### 📦 GitHub Status

✅ **Successfully pushed to GitHub**
- Repository: https://github.com/ai-cherry/sophia-intel-ai
- Branch: main
- Commit: 160bed7
