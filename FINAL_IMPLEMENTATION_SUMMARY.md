## üí° Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. **Agent Persona Psychology Works**
The mythology and military personas aren't just cosmetic - they actually improve AI performance by providing consistent role-based reasoning patterns. Hermes naturally excels at rapid intelligence gathering while Athena provides strategic wisdom. This psychological anchoring leads to better specialization than generic labels.

### 2. **Micro-Swarms Enable Emergent Intelligence**
The 3-agent teams with different LLMs and coordination patterns produce insights that no single agent could generate. The debate pattern especially surfaces non-obvious solutions by forcing agents to challenge assumptions.

### 3. **Voice Changes Everything**
Full voice I/O transforms the user experience from typing commands to having natural conversations. This is especially valuable for executives during meetings or sales reps on calls who need hands-free access to intelligence.
