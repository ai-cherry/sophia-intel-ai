# Framework Comparison: Agno vs AutoGen vs Custom

## Executive Summary

We have THREE viable options for our Platinum swarm implementation:

### 1. **Agno Framework** (33k stars)
- **Repo**: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno
- **What it is**: High-performance multi-agent runtime
- **Pros**: 
  - Built-in memory, tools, knowledge management
  - Official Agent UI at github.com/agno-agi/sophia-intel-app
  - Direct OpenRouter support via LLM override
  - Active community (33k stars!)
- **Cons**: 
  - Another dependency to manage
  - May have opinions that conflict with our design

### 2. **Microsoft AutoGen** (Already installed)
- **What it is**: Microsoft's agent orchestration framework
- **Pros**:
  - GroupChat pattern perfect for debates
  - Built-in caching and optimization
  - Strong async support
  - Microsoft backing
- **Cons**:
  - No official UI
  - More complex API
  - Heavier framework

### 3. **Our Custom Stub** (Current)
- **What it is**: Minimal Agent/Team classes we created
- **Pros**:
  - Already working
  - Zero dependencies
  - Full control
  - Simple and lightweight
- **Cons**:
  - We build everything ourselves
  - No community support
  - Missing advanced features

## Grok's Integration Guide for Agno

```python
# Install
pip install openai requests litellm
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agno
cd agno && pip install -e .

# Use with OpenRouter
from agno import Agent, Team
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
)

def agent_llm_query(messages, model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        stream=True
    )
    return "".join(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "" for chunk in response)

# Create agents with different models
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher", 
    llm=agent_llm_query, 
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini"  # Cheap for research
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer", 
    llm=agent_llm_query, 
    model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"  # Quality for output
)

team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer], 
    instructions="Collaborate on report"
)
team.run("Analyze X")
```

## Recommendation

### Hybrid Approach:
1. **Keep our stub** for immediate functionality
2. **Use AutoGen** for GroupChat debates (already installed)
3. **Evaluate real Agno** for production features (memory, knowledge)

### Decision Matrix:

| Use Case | Best Framework | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Quick prototype | Our stub | Zero setup, works now |
| Debate patterns | AutoGen | GroupChat is perfect |
| Production system | Agno | Memory, tools, UI included |
| Cost optimization | Any + OpenRouter | All support it |

## Next Steps

1. **Test current implementation** with our stub
2. **Try Agno playground**: `agno playground` 
3. **Compare performance** between all three
4. **Choose based on actual needs**, not assumptions

## Key Insight from Grok

The most important finding: **OpenRouter works identically with all frameworks** because it's OpenAI-compatible. We can switch frameworks without changing our LLM integration.

```python
# This works in ALL frameworks:
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
)
```

## Deployment Notes (from Grok)

### Local M3 Mac:
- All frameworks work native on ARM64
- No GPU needed (use OpenRouter for inference)
- Test with: `agno agent create myagent.py`

### Fly.io (Recommended for production):
```toml
app = "sophia-agno"
primary_region = "sjc"

[build]
dockerfile = "Dockerfile"

[http_service]
internal_port = 7777  # Agno
```

### Cost Optimization:
- Use `openai/gpt-4o-mini` for planning (cheap)
- Use `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` for coding (quality)
- Enable caching in all frameworks
- Set max_tokens limits

## Conclusion

We don't need to unwind anything. We have three valid paths:
1. Ship with our stub (works today)
2. Enhance with AutoGen (installed)
3. Migrate to Agno if we need advanced features

The beauty: **OpenRouter works with everything**.
