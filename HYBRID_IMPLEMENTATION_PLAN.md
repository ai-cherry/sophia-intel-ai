## Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Background Monitoring Agents

#### Implementation
```python
# Location: /app/agents/background/
class BackgroundAgentManager:
    """Manages always-running monitoring agents"""
    
    agents = {
        "log_monitor": LogMonitorAgent(),      # Watches for errors/warnings
        "cost_tracker": CostTrackerAgent(),    # Tracks LLM usage costs
        "performance": PerformanceAgent(),     # Monitors response times
        "memory_guard": MemoryGuardAgent(),    # Prevents memory leaks
        "health_check": HealthCheckAgent()     # System health monitoring
    }
    
    async def start_monitoring(self):
        for agent in self.agents.values():
            asyncio.create_task(agent.run_continuous())
```

#### Key Features
- **Log Monitor**: Detects error patterns, alerts on anomalies
- **Cost Tracker**: Real-time LLM cost tracking with budget alerts
- **Performance**: Tracks latency, throughput, success rates
- **Memory Guard**: Auto-cleanup when memory > 80%
- **Health Check**: Heartbeat monitoring, dependency checks

#### Success Metrics
- Detect 95% of issues before user impact
- Reduce manual monitoring by 80%
- Alert response time < 30 seconds

### 1.2 Enhanced Memory System

#### Implementation
```python
# Location: /app/core/memory/
class HybridMemorySystem:
    """Multi-tier memory with persistence and versioning"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.hot_cache = Redis()        # L1: Hot data (TTL: 1h)
        self.warm_cache = SQLite()      # L2: Recent data (TTL: 24h)
        self.cold_storage = PostgreSQL() # L3: Historical data
        self.vault = EncryptedVault()   # Secure configuration
        
    async def remember(self, key: str, value: Any, tier: str = "auto"):
        """Store with automatic tiering and versioning"""
        # Auto-detect appropriate tier based on access patterns
        # Version all changes with rollback capability
        pass
```

#### Key Features
- **Automatic Tiering**: Data moves between tiers based on usage
- **Version Control**: Git-like versioning for configurations
- **Rollback**: One-command rollback to any previous state
- **Cross-Session**: Persists between restarts
