## 🔧 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from app.swarms.knowledge import KnowledgeDominationSwarm

# Create elite knowledge system
swarm = KnowledgeDominationSwarm()
await swarm.initialize()

# Learn from content
await swarm.learn_from_content(
    "Advanced machine learning concepts...",
    "text",
    {"domain": "AI", "quality": "high"}
)

# Generate brilliant response
response = await swarm.generate_response(
    "How do neural networks learn?",
    {"domain": "AI", "user_level": "expert"}
)

print(f"Response: {response['response']}")
print(f"Confidence: {response['confidence']}")
print(f"Sources: {response['knowledge_sources']}")
```

### Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration
```python
from app.swarms.knowledge import create_default_agent_swarm

# Create specialized agent team
agents = create_default_agent_swarm()

# Coordinate complex response generation
result = await agents.coordinate_response_generation(
    "Design a scalable microservices architecture",
    {"complexity": "expert", "domain": "system_design"}
)
```

### Real-Time Learning
```python
from app.swarms.knowledge import ContinuousTrainingOrchestrator

# Create training system
trainer = ContinuousTrainingOrchestrator()

# Learn from user interaction
interaction_data = {
    "query": "What is quantum computing?",
    "response": "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics...",
    "feedback_score": 0.9,
    "user_corrections": []
}

await trainer.continuous_improvement_cycle(interaction_data)
```
