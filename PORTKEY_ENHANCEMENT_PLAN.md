# 🚀 Portkey Gateway Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive enhancement to implement Portkey best practices, quality gates, and performance optimizations for the slim-agno repository.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All LLM calls routed through Portkey with proper VKs
- ✅ JSON contracts enforced for Critic/Judge outputs
- ✅ Quality gates (AccuracyEval/ReliabilityEval) blocking Runner
- ✅ Performance optimizations (parallel I/O, streaming, caching)
- ✅ Observability with metadata headers and dashboards
- ✅ Security compliance (RBAC, audit logging, key rotation)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Documentation updated with best practices

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Current State
```
User → UI → Playground → LLM (direct calls)
```

### Target State
```
User → UI → Playground → Portkey Gateway → [OpenRouter/Together]
                ↓
         Quality Gates → Runner (blocked/allowed)
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Response latency < 2s for chat
- Cache hit rate > 40%
- Quality gate pass rate > 85%
- Zero security incidents
- 100% test coverage for critical paths

## 🔄 Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Update Portkey configuration (non-breaking)
2. **Phase 2**: Add quality gates (opt-in)
3. **Phase 3**: Enable performance features (gradual rollout)
4. **Phase 4**: Full observability (monitoring first)
5. **Phase 5**: Security hardening (staged)
6. **Phase 6**: Complete testing and docs

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback plan**: Feature flags for each phase
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite before each phase
- **Monitoring**: Alerts for degradation
- **Documentation**: Clear migration guides
