---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Step 1: Enable RBAC (Optional)**

```bash
# Add to your .env file
RBAC_ENABLED=true
DB_TYPE=sqlite
DB_PATH=sophia_rbac.db
```

### **Step 2: Run Database Migration**

```bash
cd sophia-intel-ai
python migrations/001_rbac_foundation.py up
```

### **Step 3: Start Server**

```bash
# Your existing server command works unchanged
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... python3 -m uvicorn dev_mcp_unified.core.mcp_server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3333 --reload
```

### **Step 4: Access Admin Panel**

```
http://localhost:3333/admin-panel.html
```

### **Step 5: Create Your First User**

The system automatically creates an owner account (`owner@sophia.ai`). Use the admin panel to invite additional users.

## üë• User Role Hierarchy

### **Owner Role** (You)

- **Full System Access**: All permissions across Sophia and Artemis domains
- **User Management**: Create/delete users, assign roles, manage permissions
- **System Configuration**: Modify system settings, access audit logs
- **Business Intelligence**: Full read/write access to all BI data
- **Agent Management**: Create, execute, and manage all AI agents

### **Admin Role** (Your Team Leads)

- **Domain Management**: Full access to assigned domains (Sophia OR Artemis)
- **User Invitations**: Invite new users, assign Member/Viewer roles
- **Business Operations**: Read/write access to business data within permissions
- **Agent Execution**: Create and execute agents within domain scope

### **Member Role** (Standard Users)

- **Standard Access**: Read access to Sophia domain, execute basic agents
- **Project Participation**: Access to assigned projects and data
- **Limited Agent Use**: Execute pre-configured agents and workflows

### **Viewer Role** (Read-Only Access)

- **Read-Only Access**: View dashboards, reports, and basic business data
- **No Modifications**: Cannot create, edit, or delete any data
- **Limited Navigation**: Access only to assigned viewing areas

---

## üîí Permission System

### **Domain-Level Permissions**

```
sophia.read     # Access Sophia business intelligence features
sophia.write    # Modify business data and create reports
artemis.read    # View technical/agent systems
artemis.write   # Create and modify agents, execute swarms
```

### **Service-Level Permissions**

```
user.manage     # Create/delete users, assign roles
user.invite     # Send user invitations
system.config   # Modify system settings
agent.create    # Create new AI agents
agent.execute   # Execute existing agents
bi.read         # Access business intelligence data
bi.write        # Modify business intelligence data
```

### **Data Classification Levels**

- **Public**: General business information (accessible to all roles)
- **Internal**: Company operational data (Member+ access)
- **Confidential**: Financial reports, contracts (Admin+ access)
- **Restricted**: Employee PII, sensitive financial data (Owner only)
- **Proprietary**: Trade secrets, strategic plans (Owner only)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### **Database Schema**

```sql
-- Core user management
users (user_id, email, role, created_at, is_active)
user_permissions (user_id, permission, granted_at)
audit_log (id, user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, details, timestamp)

-- Migration tracking
schema_migrations (version, applied_at)
```

### **API Endpoints**

```
GET    /api/admin/users           # List all users
POST   /api/admin/users           # Create new user
GET    /api/admin/users/{id}      # Get user details
PUT    /api/admin/users/{id}      # Update user role
DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}      # Deactivate user
POST   /api/admin/users/invite    # Send invitation
GET    /api/admin/permissions/check # Check user permission
GET    /api/admin/permissions/list  # List user permissions
GET    /api/admin/me              # Current user profile
GET    /api/admin/system/health   # System health status
```

### **Authentication Flow**

```
1. User logs in with existing JWT system
2. RBAC system loads user permissions from database
3. Each API request checks required permissions
4. Access granted/denied based on role hierarchy
5. All actions logged to audit trail
```

---

## üìä Testing & Validation

### **Run Integration Tests**

```bash
# Run comprehensive RBAC tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_rbac_integration.py -v

# Run existing tests to ensure no regression
python -m pytest tests/integration/business_intelligence/ -v
```

### **Manual Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Admin panel loads correctly
- [ ] User creation and role assignment works
- [ ] Permission checking prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Existing MCP server functionality unchanged
- [ ] Database migration completes successfully
- [ ] System health monitoring shows green status

---

## üîÑ Deployment Strategy

### **Development Environment**

```bash
# Use SQLite for local development
export DB_TYPE=sqlite
export DB_PATH=dev_rbac.db
export RBAC_ENABLED=true
```

### **Production Environment**

```bash
# Use PostgreSQL for production
export DB_TYPE=postgresql
export DB_HOST=your-postgres-host
export DB_NAME=sophia_prod
export DB_USER=sophia_user
export DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
export RBAC_ENABLED=true
```

### **Rollback Procedure**

```bash
# Emergency rollback if issues occur
export RBAC_ENABLED=false

# Revert database changes
python migrations/001_rbac_foundation.py down

# Restart server (automatically excludes RBAC routes)
```

---

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### **Health Checks**

```bash
# Check RBAC system health
curl http://localhost:3333/api/admin/system/health

# Verify user permissions
curl http://localhost:3333/api/admin/permissions/check?permission=sophia.read
```

### **Audit Trail Queries**

```sql
-- Recent user activities
SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50;

-- Permission changes
SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE action LIKE '%permission%';

-- User creation activity
SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE action = 'user_created';
```

### **Performance Monitoring**

- Monitor authentication response times (target: <50ms)
- Track permission check frequency and caching effectiveness
- Watch for failed authentication attempts and potential security issues

---

## üö® Security Considerations

### **Password & Access Management**

- Use existing JWT token system with enhanced permission loading
- Implement session timeouts and concurrent session limits
- Enable audit logging for all user actions and permission changes

### **Data Protection**

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using database-level encryption
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation
- Regular audit trail reviews and access certification

### **Network Security**

- API endpoints require authentication for all management functions
- Rate limiting on authentication and user management endpoints
- HTTPS enforced in production environments

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### **Phase 2 Additions** (Weeks 7-12)

- **Email Integration**: Automated invitation emails with onboarding
- **Advanced Permissions**: Resource-level permissions and custom roles
- **Single Sign-On**: SAML/OAuth integration for enterprise authentication
- **Advanced Audit**: Comprehensive reporting and compliance features

### **Phase 3 Enterprise** (Weeks 13-18)

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Full tenant isolation and resource quotas
- **Advanced Security**: MFA, device management, and advanced threat detection
- **API Rate Limiting**: User-based rate limits and resource quotas
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time security alerts and anomaly detection

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Will this break my existing setup?**

**A**: No. RBAC is controlled by environment variables and only adds functionality. All existing endpoints work unchanged.

### **Q: How do I disable RBAC if needed?**

**A**: Set `RBAC_ENABLED=false` in your environment and restart the server. All RBAC features are disabled.

### **Q: Can I migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL later?**

**A**: Yes. The database-agnostic migration system supports moving between database types.

### **Q: What happens if the RBAC database is corrupted?**

**A**: The system falls back to the original JWT-only authentication. RBAC features are disabled but core functionality remains.

### **Q: How do I backup user data?**

**A**: Use standard database backup procedures. SQLite files can be copied directly; PostgreSQL uses `pg_dump`.
