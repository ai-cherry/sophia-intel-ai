- Maintain single application with clear Sophia/Artemis domain boundaries
- Leverage shared infrastructure (authentication, monitoring, vector stores)
- Enable cross-domain intelligence through universal orchestrator
- Implement hierarchical security with 4-level access control

### **Code Planner Implementation Strategy**

**Detailed 12-Week Roadmap**:

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): User management foundation and audit systems
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Universal interface and research automation
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Advanced features and enterprise readiness

### **UX Designer Interface Vision**

**User-Centered Design Approach**:

- Universal chat interface with intelligent domain detection
- Progressive disclosure of complex enterprise features
- Mobile-responsive design with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Context preservation across domain transitions

### **Quality Reviewer Critical Assessment**

**Major Finding**: **Scope vs Timeline Mismatch**

- Current 12-week timeline unrealistic for proposed scope
- Integration complexity underestimated with existing 15+ FastAPI routers
- Recommended scope reduction to 6-week MVP focusing on core user management

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES & STRATEGIC ADJUSTMENTS

### **Issue #1: Timeline Feasibility (CRITICAL)**

**Problem**: 12-week timeline insufficient for enterprise-grade feature scope
**Evidence**: Complex existing MCP server architecture requires careful integration
**Solution**: **Reduce to 6-week MVP** focusing on essential user management only

### **Issue #2: Integration Complexity (HIGH)**

**Problem**: Existing FastAPI architecture has intricate routing patterns not fully accounted for
**Solution**: Create detailed integration testing plan with phased rollout strategy

### **Issue #3: Database Architecture Mismatch (HIGH)**

**Problem**: Design assumes SQLite but production likely uses PostgreSQL
**Solution**: Design database-agnostic user management with proper migration tooling

---

## 📈 REVISED 3-PHASE STRATEGIC PLAN

## **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & CORE USER MANAGEMENT** _(Weeks 1-6)_

### **🎯 Scope-Focused Objectives**

- Implement hierarchical user management (Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer)
- Extend existing JWT authentication system
- Create admin interface integrated with existing 6-pane UI
- Establish database migration framework for SQLite/PostgreSQL support

### **🔧 Technical Implementation**

```python
# Core User Management Service
class UserManagementService:
    """Simplified 2-level permission system"""
    platform_role: str  # owner, admin, member, viewer
    service_access: Dict[str, List[str]]  # {"artemis": ["read", "write"], "sophia": ["read"]}

# Extend existing authentication pattern
def enhanced_verify_token_with_permissions(authorization: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    if not authorization:
        return None, {}

    user_id, permissions = auth_manager.verify_token(authorization.replace("Bearer ", ""))
    return user_id, permissions
```

### **🎨 UI Integration Strategy**

```javascript
// Add admin tab to existing multi-chat-six.html pattern
const tabs = [
  { id: "artemis", name: "Artemis", icon: "🤖", access: "artemis" },
  { id: "factory", name: "Factory", icon: "🏭", access: "agent_factory" },
  { id: "sophia", name: "Sophia", icon: "📊", access: "sophia" },
  { id: "analytics", name: "Analytics", icon: "📈", access: "analytics" },
  { id: "admin", name: "Admin", icon: "⚙️", access: "admin", adminOnly: true },
