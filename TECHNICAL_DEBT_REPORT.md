**Issue**: REST-only API  
**Impact**: Multiple requests needed for complex queries  
**Recommendation**:
- Add GraphQL layer alongside REST
- Implement DataLoader for N+1 prevention
- Add subscription support
**Effort**: 1 week

#### 4.2 Multi-tenancy
**Issue**: Single-tenant architecture  
**Impact**: Cannot support multiple organizations  
**Recommendation**:
