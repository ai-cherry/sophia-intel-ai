L2 (Weaviate)  →  Vector search, semantic (hybrid α=0.65)  
L3 (Neon)      →  Structured facts, ACID transactions
L4 (S3)        →  Cold archive, compliance retention
```

4. **Ensures Reliability:** Implements comprehensive monitoring and fallback mechanisms

**Key Success Factors:**
- Phased implementation with clear success metrics
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Stakeholder alignment on architectural decisions
- Continuous monitoring and optimization

**Next Steps:**
1. Stakeholder review and approval of blueprint
2. Resource allocation for implementation phases

**Three Key Observations for Enhancement:**

1. **Architectural Maturity Acceleration:** Consider implementing a formal Architecture Decision Record (ADR) system to capture the rationale behind consolidation decisions and prevent future fragmentation.

2. **AI-Native Observability:** The platform would benefit from semantic monitoring that goes beyond traditional metrics - tracking reasoning quality, decision consistency, and knowledge synthesis effectiveness across agent interactions.

3. **Evolutionary Agent Architecture:** Implement agent capability versioning and A/B testing frameworks to allow for continuous improvement of agent behaviors without disrupting production workloads.
