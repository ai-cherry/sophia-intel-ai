- **Secure Connection Handling**: Authentication before connection acceptance
- **Message Security**: Validation and authorization for all messages
- **Emergency Response**: Lockdown capabilities for critical threats
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Security and performance monitoring

### 5. Security Configuration (`websocket_security_config.py`)
- **Environment Presets**: Development, staging, production configurations
- **Validation**: Configuration validation with security warnings
- **Pay Ready Focus**: Special configurations for financial data protection

### 6. Factory Pattern (`secure_websocket_factory.py`)
- **Easy Integration**: Simple factory for creating secure managers
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic configuration based on environment
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in security monitoring and alerting

## Usage Examples

### Basic Secure WebSocket Server
```python
from app.core.secure_websocket_factory import SecureWebSocketFactory

# Create secure WebSocket manager
ws_manager = await SecureWebSocketFactory.create_manager(environment="production")

# Use in FastAPI
@app.websocket("/ws/{client_id}/{session_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket, client_id: str, session_id: str, token: str = Query(None)):
    await ws_manager.websocket_endpoint(websocket, client_id, session_id, token)
```

### Pay Ready Focused Security
```python
# Maximum security for Pay Ready operations
pay_ready_manager = await SecureWebSocketFactory.create_pay_ready_manager()
```

### Security Monitoring
```python
# Get comprehensive security status
security_status = await ws_manager.get_security_status()

# Emergency lockdown
await ws_manager.emergency_security_lockdown(duration_minutes=30)

# Export audit logs
audit_logs = await ws_manager.audit_log_export(hours=24)
```

  "authenticated_connections": 145,
  "security_violations": 3,
  "rate_limit_violations": 12,
  "blocked_clients": 2,
  "ddos_alert_level": "normal",
  "recent_security_events": 5,
  "connection_breakdown": {
    "by_tenant": {

    }
  }
}
```

## Emergency Response

### Automatic Responses
- **High Rate Violations**: Progressive backoff (5s → 30s → 5min → 30min → 1hr)
- **Security Threats**: Immediate client blocking
- **DDoS Detection**: Emergency rate limiting activation
- **Cross-Tenant Violations**: Instant connection termination

### Manual Interventions
- **Emergency Lockdown**: Disconnect anonymous users, apply strict limits
- **Client Unblocking**: Admin override for false positives
- **Audit Export**: On-demand compliance reporting

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Sophia Intelligence
- Authenticated access to operational insights
- Team performance data protection
- Tenant-specific intelligence filtering

### Artemis Tactical
- Secure tactical operation channels
- Deployment event monitoring
- Military-grade security standards

### Pay Ready Business
- Maximum security for financial data
