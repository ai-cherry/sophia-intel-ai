## ðŸ›  Usage Examples

### Quick Start

```python
from app.agents import get_factory, create_quick_agent, create_quick_swarm

# Create a single agent
agent = await create_quick_agent("senior_developer")
result = await execute_quick_task(
    agent.instance_id,
    "Write a Python REST API for user authentication"
)

# Create a swarm for complex tasks
swarm = await create_quick_swarm("software_development")
result = await factory.execute_swarm_task(
    swarm.instance_id,
    "Build a complete e-commerce platform with microservices"
)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Get factory instance
factory = await get_factory(
    portkey_api_key="your_key",
    openrouter_api_key="your_key"
)

# Create custom agent
agent = await factory.create_agent(
    "architect",
    instance_name="Senior System Architect",
    config_overrides={"temperature": 0.1},
    context={"project": "enterprise_platform"}
)

# Get performance metrics
metrics = factory.get_agent_metrics(agent.instance_id)
print(f"Success rate: {metrics['performance']['success_rate']}")
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

- **50 concurrent agents** maximum
- **10 concurrent swarms** maximum
- **Automatic resource management** and cleanup
- **Database connection pooling**

### Cost Optimization

- **Tiered agent pricing** (Basic/Standard/Premium/Enterprise)
- **Dynamic model selection** based on budget
- **Real-time cost tracking** and limits
- **Fallback to cheaper models** when appropriate

### Reliability

- **Circuit breaker** patterns for external APIs
- **Comprehensive error handling** with retry logic
- **Health monitoring** and automatic recovery
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable

## ðŸ”Œ API Endpoints

The system provides full REST API access:

- `GET /agent-factory/status` - Factory system status
- `GET /agent-factory/catalog/blueprints` - List agent blueprints
- `GET /agent-factory/catalog/swarms` - List swarm configurations
- `POST /agent-factory/agents` - Create new agent
- `POST /agent-factory/swarms` - Create new swarm
- `POST /agent-factory/agents/{id}/tasks` - Execute agent task
- `POST /agent-factory/swarms/{id}/tasks` - Execute swarm task
- `GET /agent-factory/agents/{id}/metrics` - Agent performance metrics
- WebSocket at `/ws/agent-factory` for real-time updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Production

### Immediate Value

1. **12+ specialized agents** ready to use out-of-the-box
2. **6 swarm templates** for common workflows
3. **Complete FastAPI integration** with existing Sophia systems
4. **Real-time monitoring** and analytics
5. **Cost-optimized** AI model usage

### Integration Points

- âœ… **Portkey virtual keys** for model access
- âœ… **Existing agent configurations** and role strategies
- âœ… **Connection manager** for pooled HTTP/Redis connections
- âœ… **Prometheus metrics** for observability
- âœ… **SQLAlchemy** for database persistence

### Next Steps

1. **Run the demo**: `python app/agents/demo.py`
2. **Add API keys** to `<repo>/.env.master` for full functionality (single source)
3. **Import routes** into your FastAPI app
4. **Start creating agents** and swarms immediately

## ðŸ§  AI Innovation Ideas

Based on this implementation, here are 3 forward-thinking observations:

1. **Emergent Swarm Intelligence**: The multi-agent orchestration system creates opportunities for emergent behaviors where swarms develop specialized communication patterns and optimization strategies that weren't explicitly programmed.

2. **Cost-Adaptive AI Architecture**: The tiered pricing model with dynamic model selection enables "AI budget optimization" - automatically scaling AI capability based on task complexity and available resources, similar to cloud auto-scaling but for intelligence.

3. **Agent Specialization Evolution**: The blueprint system with performance tracking creates a foundation for agents that could automatically evolve their capabilities based on success metrics, potentially leading to self-improving AI specialists.
