üìä **Observability Analysis:**
Current monitoring setup provides good basic coverage with opportunities for enhanced observability.

**Current Monitoring Stack:**
‚Ä¢ Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana (Good coverage)
‚Ä¢ Logging: ELK Stack (Adequate but needs tuning)
‚Ä¢ Tracing: Jaeger (Basic implementation)
‚Ä¢ Alerting: AlertManager (Functional)
‚Ä¢ Uptime Monitoring: External service monitoring

**Monitoring Strengths:**
‚Ä¢ Core system metrics properly tracked
‚Ä¢ Business KPIs integrated into dashboards
‚Ä¢ Alert fatigue minimized with proper thresholds
‚Ä¢ Historical data retention properly configured
‚Ä¢ Monitoring infrastructure is resilient

**Monitoring Gaps:**
‚Ä¢ Application-level metrics insufficient
‚Ä¢ Distributed tracing coverage incomplete
‚Ä¢ Log correlation across services difficult
‚Ä¢ User experience monitoring missing
‚Ä¢ Cost monitoring not comprehensive

**Enhanced Observability Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Implement custom application metrics for business logic
‚Ä¢ Expand distributed tracing to cover all service interactions
‚Ä¢ Add centralized log correlation with trace IDs
‚Ä¢ Implement real user monitoring (RUM) for frontend
‚Ä¢ Add comprehensive cloud cost monitoring and alerting

**Alerting Strategy:**
‚Ä¢ SLO-based alerting for critical user journeys
‚Ä¢ Predictive alerting for capacity planning
‚Ä¢ Intelligent alert grouping to reduce noise
‚Ä¢ Integration with incident management workflow

Monitoring grade: B (Good foundation, needs strategic enhancements for enterprise observability)"""
