## ðŸš¨ Remediation Workflows

### MCP Server Failure Recovery

Create automated recovery script that:
1. Detects service failure via port check
2. Kills existing process and clears locks
3. Restarts service with proper logging
4. Verifies recovery and sends notifications
5. Monitors continuously with 60-second intervals

### Data Pipeline Interruption Response

Implement PipelineRecoveryWorkflow class with:
- Automatic severity assessment
- Notification based on severity level
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Checkpoint-based recovery
- Data consistency verification
- Manual escalation if auto-recovery fails

### Redis Data Loss Prevention

Prevention measures:
- Enable AOF with fsync every second
- Configure RDB snapshots every 5 minutes
- Replicate to secondary Redis instance
- Backup to S3 every hour

Recovery procedure:
1. Stop all write operations immediately
2. Assess data loss extent and check AOF integrity
3. Try AOF recovery, fallback to RDB, then S3
4. Validate recovery with key counts and consistency checks
5. Resume writes gradually with monitoring

### NPM Process Crash Recovery

Deploy PM2 configuration with:
- Single instance enforcement
- Max 10 restarts with 10s minimum uptime
- Memory limit of 500MB
- Comprehensive logging
- Auto-recovery on crash
- Escalation to on-call if recovery fails
