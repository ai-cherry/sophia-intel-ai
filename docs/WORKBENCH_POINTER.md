# Workbench UI (External)

The Workbench UI is maintained in a separate repository to keep this repo focused on backends/integrations and MCP.

- Recommended location: `../worktrees/workbench-ui` (via git worktree)
- Extraction guide: see `docs/WORKBENCH_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md`
- Scaffold a local worktree: `bash scripts/scaffold_workbench_ui.sh ../worktrees/workbench-ui`
- After creation, set the remote and push per the extraction plan.

Once the new repository is created, add the URL here:
