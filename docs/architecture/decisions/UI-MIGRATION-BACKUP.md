# UI Migration Backup & Rollback Procedures

## Migration Context

**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Phase**: Final UI Consolidation - Phase 4  
**Task**: Safe removal of legacy ui/ directory after successful migration to agent-ui/

## Backup Details

### Backup Location

- **Directory**: `ui-backup-20250901_100740`
- **Full Path**: `/Users/lynnmusil/sophia-intel-ai/ui-backup-20250901_100740`
- **Created**: 2025-09-01 10:07:40 PST
- **Size**: 26 directories and files

### Backup Contents

The backup contains all original ui/ directory contents including:

- 8 unique swarm components that were migrated
- Complete Next.js project structure
- All dependencies and configuration files
- Test files and documentation
- Build artifacts and caches

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback

If immediate rollback is needed after ui/ directory removal:

```bash
# From project root directory
mv ui-backup-20250901_100740 ui
```

### Verification After Rollback

1. Check ui/ directory structure is restored
2. Verify swarm components are accessible
3. Test any references that were updated in Phase 3

### Full System Rollback

If complete rollback to pre-migration state is needed:

1. **Restore ui/ directory**:

   ```bash
   mv ui-backup-20250901_100740 ui
   ```

2. **Remove migrated components from agent-ui/**:

   ```bash
   rm -rf agent-ui/src/components/swarm/
   rm agent-ui/src/types/swarm.ts
   rm agent-ui/src/lib/endpointUtils.ts
   rm agent-ui/src/lib/fetchUtils.ts
   rm agent-ui/src/lib/streamUtils.ts
   ```

3. **Revert reference updates** (if Phase 3 changes need reversal):
   - Check git history for specific file changes
   - Manually revert import paths from agent-ui/ back to ui/

## Validation Completed Before Backup

✅ **Application Startup**: agent-ui successfully runs on port 3333  
✅ **Component Rendering**: All UI components display without errors  
✅ **Functionality**: EndpointPicker, TeamWorkflowPanel, StreamView work correctly  
✅ **Integration**: Proper integration with agent-ui/ store patterns  
✅ **TypeScript**: Compilation succeeds (excluding unrelated MarkdownRenderer issues)

## Safety Notes

- **DO NOT** remove the backup directory until migration is completely stable
- The backup preserves the exact state before ui/ directory removal
- All 258+ reference updates from Phase 3 were validated before backup creation
- Agent-ui/ application demonstrated full functionality during testing

## Contact & Support

If rollback is needed:

1. Follow procedures above
2. Document any issues encountered
3. Review ADR-001 for additional context
4. Check git history for reference to specific changes made
