## 🔄 Phase-by-Phase Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Deployment (Blue-Green)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Critical Path**: Weaviate must be stable before proceeding

```yaml
Weaviate Deployment:
  Strategy: Blue-Green with validation gates
  Validation Gates:
    1. Health Check: /v1/.well-known/ready (30s timeout)
    2. Meta API: /v1/meta responds with version info
    3. RQ Compression: Verify 75% memory reduction active
  Rollback Criteria: >30s response time OR failed health checks
  Auto-Recovery: Restart with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
```

### Phase 2: Processing Layer (Parallel Blue-Green)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: Weaviate operational

```yaml
MCP Server & Vector Store:
  Strategy: Parallel Blue-Green deployment
  Circuit Breaker: 
    - Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
    - Recovery timeout: 30 seconds
    - Half-open state: 3 test requests
  Validation Gates:
    1. Service health: /health endpoints responding
    2. Weaviate connectivity: Vector operations successful
    3. Memory deduplication: >90% duplicate detection
```

### Phase 3: Core API (Canary Deployment)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Strategy**: 10% → 50% → 100% traffic shift

```yaml
Unified API Deployment:
  Strategy: Canary with automated promotion
  Traffic Shift Schedule:
    - 10% traffic: 15 minutes
    - 50% traffic: 30 minutes  
    - 100% traffic: Auto-promote if metrics healthy
  Success Criteria:
    - Error rate: <1%
    - P95 latency: <200ms
    - Consensus swarm success: >95%
```

### Phase 4: Interface Layer (Rolling Deployment)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Strategy**: Rolling deployment with immediate traffic

```yaml
Agno Bridge & Agent UI:
  Strategy: Rolling deployment
  Health Validation:
    - UI responsiveness: <100ms first paint
    - API connectivity: All endpoints reachable
    - CORS configuration: Verified for production domains
```

## 🛡️ Stability Engineering Patterns

### 1. Enhanced Health Check System
```python
# app/api/health_enhanced.py
class ProductionHealthChecker:
    async def deep_dependency_check(self):
        checks = {
            'weaviate': self.check_weaviate_cluster(),
            'redis': self.check_redis_cluster(),  
            'postgres': self.check_postgres_connection(),
            'mcp_server': self.check_mcp_dependency(),
            'vector_store': self.check_vector_dependency(),
            'lambda_gpu': self.check_gpu_availability()
        }
        # Auto-recovery logic for failed dependencies
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Implementation
```yaml
Circuit Breaker Configuration:
  Weaviate:
    failure_threshold: 5
    recovery_timeout: 30s
    half_open_max_calls: 3
  External APIs:
    failure_threshold: 10
    recovery_timeout: 60s
    fallback_strategy: 'cached_response'
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation Strategy
```yaml
Service Degradation Levels:
  Level 1 - Full Operation: All services operational
  Level 2 - GPU Degraded: CPU-only consensus swarms
  Level 3 - Vector Degraded: Cached embeddings only
  Level 4 - Emergency Mode: Basic API with static responses
```

---

## 🌐 Multi-Region Resilience Architecture

### Primary Region: SJC (San Jose)
- All 6 services with full auto-scaling
- Hot standby for immediate failover

### Secondary Region: LAX (Los Angeles) 
- Cold standby with 15-minute activation
- Automated DNS failover via Fly.io

```yaml
Failover Configuration:
  DNS TTL: 60 seconds
  Health Check Interval: 10 seconds  
  Failover Trigger: 3 consecutive health check failures
  RTO Target: <15 minutes
  RPO Target: <5 minutes (via Neon multi-AZ)
```

---

## 📈 High Performance Optimization Plan

### 1. Predictive Auto-Scaling
```yaml
Unified API Scaling:
  Predictive Triggers:
    - Consensus swarm queue length > 5
    - Memory deduplication backlog > 100
    - P95 latency > 150ms for 2 consecutive minutes
  Scale-up: Add 2 instances immediately
  Scale-down: Remove 1 instance after 10 minutes below threshold
```

### 2. Performance Targets
```yaml
Service Level Objectives:
  Availability: 99.9% (8.77 hours downtime/year)
  Latency P95: <150ms
  Latency P99: <300ms
  Scale-up Time: <30 seconds
  Consensus Accuracy: >95%
  Memory Deduplication: >90%
```

### 3. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Neon PostgreSQL Optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_memory_hash ON memories USING HASH(content_hash);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_consensus_timestamp ON consensus_results(created_at);
-- Connection pooling: 20 connections per API instance
```

### 4. CDN and Caching Strategy
```yaml
Caching Layers:
  L1 - Redis: Consensus results (TTL: 1 hour)
  L2 - Vector embeddings: Persistent cache (TTL: 24 hours)
  L3 - UI Assets: Fly.io CDN (TTL: 7 days)
```
