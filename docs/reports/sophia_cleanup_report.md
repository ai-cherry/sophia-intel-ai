# Repository Cleanup Report
Date: 2025-09-16

## Summary
- Files archived: 65 items moved into `.repo_backup_20250916_091901/` (plus earlier dry-run folder `.repo_backup_20250916_091700/`)
- Space reclaimed: run `du -sh .repo_backup_20250916_091901` before deleting once reviewed
- Environment copies consolidated: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.local.example` removed from root; `.env.master` remains source of truth
- Root clutter reduced: 50+ JSON audit/test dumps relocated, deprecated docs archived, temp directories (`tmp/`) removed from active tree
- Cleanup script available at `scripts/cleanup/sophia_cleanup.sh` for future runs

## Actions Taken
### Removed Files (archived in backup)
- Environment + assistant artefacts: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.local.example`, `.home/.claude.json.backup`, `agent_mcp_startup_report_*.json`, `tmp/`
- Audit/Test JSON dumps: `*report*.json`, `*results*.json`, `*analysis*.json` at repo root including `system_audit_report.json`, `integration_test_report_*`, `load_test_results.json`, etc.
- Deprecated docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `START.md`, `STARTUP_GUIDE.md`, `COMPLETE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`, `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`

### Consolidated Files
- Created [`docs/SETUP.md`](../SETUP.md) as the single setup reference; kept `START_HERE.md` for quick on-boarding and updated README to point at both
- Added `.repo_backup_*/` to `.gitignore`

### Branch Cleanup
- Not executed. Git operations requiring writes (stash/branch prune) remain blocked by sandbox. Local branch list unchanged.

## Remaining Issues
- Backup folders (`.repo_backup_*`) remain inside the repo for validation; move or delete once contents are reviewed.
- Numerous scripts under `scripts/` and `automation/` look one-off; consider migrating verified utilities into `scripts/cleanup/` and deleting unused ones.
- Large directories (`.ai/`, `.cursor/`, `logs/`, `backups/`) were left untouched—review manually if further reduction is desired.

## Recommendations
1. After verifying the archive, remove `.repo_backup_*` directories to reclaim disk space (3.3 GB repo currently).
2. Expand `scripts/cleanup/sophia_cleanup.sh` with additional patterns if new audit files appear regularly.
3. Once sandbox limitations lift, run `git fetch --prune` and clean merged branches; ensure the pre-existing diffs in `Makefile`, `app/api/main.py`, etc., are handled before committing.
4. Keep setup instructions in `docs/SETUP.md` up to date whenever environment policies change to prevent future duplication.
