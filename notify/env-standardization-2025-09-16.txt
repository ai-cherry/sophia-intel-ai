Subject: Environment Standardization Alignment

Teams: Platform, Integrations, Security Ops

Summary: Converging on `.env.template` as canonical env template with encrypted runtime copy. Deprecating `.env.example` and `.env.master` once migration tooling lands. Unified loader will merge `.env.template` + `config/*.yml` with Convict/Zod validation.

Requested Actions:
1. Review proposed plan and flag blockers by EOD 2025-09-17.
2. Provide list of scripts/jobs under your ownership that source `.env.master` or `.env.example`.
3. Identify any production deploys that depend on legacy filenames so we can include them in migration testing.

Next Steps:
- Codex agent delivering inventory tooling + migration scripts.
- Follow-up working session pending your feedback.

Thank you!
