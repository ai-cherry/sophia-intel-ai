StuckAccount Model\nThis model will track accounts that are stuck in the payment process and classify them by severity.\n\n```python\nclass StuckAccount:\n    def __init__(self, account_id: str, severity_level: str, description: str, timestamp: datetime):\n        self.account_id = account_id  # Unique identifier for the account\n        self.severity_level = severity_level  # e.g., \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"Critical\"\n        self.description = description  # Description of the issue\n        self.timestamp = timestamp  # When the account was marked as stuck\n```\n\n#### 2. TeamPerformanceMetrics Model\nThis model will be used to track the performance metrics of different teams.\n\n```python\nclass TeamPerformanceMetrics:\n    def __init__(self, team_name: str, completed_tasks: int, total_tasks: int, velocity: float):\n        self.team_name = team_name  # Name of the team (e.g., \"Buzz Team\", \"Recovery Team\")\n        self.completed_tasks = completed_tasks  # Number of tasks completed\n        self.total_tasks = total_tasks  # Total number of tasks assigned\n        self.velocity = velocity  # Velocity of task completion (completed_tasks / total_tasks)\n```\n\n#### 3. CrossPlatformActivity Model\nThis model will capture activities across different platforms for unified tracking.\n\n```python\nclass CrossPlatformActivity:\n    def __init__(self, user_id: str, action: str, platform: str, timestamp: datetime):\n        self.user_id = user_id  # User identifier\n        self.action = action  # Action taken (e.g., \"viewed report\", \"completed task\")\n        self.platform = platform  # Platform from which action was taken (e.g., \"Web\", \"Mobile\")\n        self.timestamp = timestamp  # When the action occurred\n```\n\n### API Structure\n\n#### API Endpoints\n\n1. **Stuck Account API**\n   - **GET /api/stuck-accounts**\n     - Description: Retrieve a list of all stuck accounts.\n     - Response: List of `StuckAccount` objects.\n   \n   - **POST /api/stuck-accounts**\n     - Description: Add a new stuck account.\n     - Request Body: `StuckAccount` object.\n     - Response: Confirmation message.\n\n2. **Team Performance Metrics API**\n   - **GET /api/team-performance**\n     - Description: Retrieve performance metrics for all teams.\n     - Response: List of `TeamPerformanceMetrics` objects.\n\n   - **PUT /api/team-performance/{team_name}**\n     - Description: Update performance metrics for a specific team.\n     - Request Body: Updated `TeamPerformanceMetrics` object.\n     - Response: Confirmation message.\n\n3. **Cross-Platform Activity API**\n   - **GET /api/cross-platform-activity**\n     - Description: Retrieve a list of cross-platform activities.\n     - Response: List of `CrossPlatformActivity` objects.\n\n   - **POST /api/cross-platform-activity**\n     - Description: Log a new cross-platform activity.\n     - Request Body: `CrossPlatformActivity` object.\n     - Response: Confirmation message.\n\n### WebSocket Event Types\n\nFor real-time updates, we can define the following WebSocket event types:\n\n1. **stuckAccountUpdated**\n   - Description: Triggered when a stuck account is created or updated.\n   - Payload: `StuckAccount` object.\n\n2. **teamPerformanceUpdated**\n   - Description: Triggered when team performance metrics are updated.\n   - Payload: `TeamPerformanceMetrics` object.\n\n3. **crossPlatformActivityLogged**\n   - Description: Triggered when a cross-platform activity is logged.\n   - Payload: `CrossPlatformActivity` object.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis design provides a comprehensive approach to the Pay Ready operational intelligence requirements. By implementing the defined models and API endpoints, the system can effectively monitor stuck accounts, track team performance, and log cross-platform activities, while facilitating real-time updates through WebSocket events. This structure should help reduce manual report views and address performance disparities among teams.",
