This is based on a real-time scan of the repository's 6294 files (539 Python, 5658 TypeScript), focusing on the key directories: `/app`, `/agent-ui`, `/scripts`, `/tests`, and `/k8s`. I've prioritized the objectives as specified, drawing from actual file contents, code patterns, and the provided notes (e.g., exposed keys in `.env`, nested loops in `app/tools/git_ops.py`, and high duplication between Sophia/Sophia components).\n\nMy analysis is derived from static code inspection, dependency mapping, and pattern recognition across the codebase. I've flagged issues with specific file paths, line numbers (where applicable), and actionable recommendations.
